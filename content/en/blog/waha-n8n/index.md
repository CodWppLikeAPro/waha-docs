## Installation

### Install WAHA
Make sure you have WAHA up and running.

If not - follow
[**âš¡ Quick Start**](https://waha.devlike.pro/docs/overview/quick-start/)
so you have WAHA available on
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### Install n8n
Kindly follow [n8n Installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/#starting-n8n) for that part.


### Install WAHA node
Go to your n8n installation => **Settings** => **Community nodes** and install:

```
@devlikeapro/n8n-nodes-waha
```

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.

## Credentials

Before using the node you need to add **WAHA API** credentials.
Go to your n8n installation and create a new
[WAHA API credential](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/add-edit-credentials/)

If it doesn't allow you to **Save** it (no save button) - just put any string in `Api Key` field, know issue :(

   of the n8n window and selecting **Import from URL**.
4. Paste the url to import workflow
5. Select credentials for all WAHA nodes
