üëâ If you wish to follow a Step-By-Step guide which show you how to send you first message via HTTP API
please go to [**‚ö° Quick Start**]({{< relref "/docs/overview/quick-start" >}}).

You probably already have run the docker run command during
[**‚ö° Quick Start**]({{< relref "/docs/overview/quick-start" >}}) guide:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000/tcp --name waha devlikeapro/waha
```

‚òùÔ∏è The above command is good **for testing and development purposes**, but **not for production**.

To make it **production-ready**, you need to configure few more parameters to make it secure, reliable, and easy to manage.



## Requirements
### Operating System
You can use any operating system for host system (Linux, Windows or macOS)
as long as you have Docker installed, and it can run **Linux** containers.

**Linux** is the most recommended operating system for running Docker containers.

üí° We recommend using **Linux** with **Debian** or **Ubuntu** based distributions.

{{< details "<b>Linux</b>" >}}
üëâ We suggest using **Debian** or **Ubuntu** based distributions.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "<b>Windows</b>" >}}
üëâ For **Windows** we kindly suggest using **Hyper-V** backend for 
[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)!

It might not work with **WSL2** backend properly.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "<b>macOS (Apple Silicon)</b>" >}}
üëâ If you're using **Apple Silicon** (like Apple M1) - you need to use the `:arm` tag for the image.

Go to
[**Docker Image Configurator**](https://portal.devlike.pro/docker-image)
to generate the command with the right image.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "<b>Raspberry Pi</b>" >}}
üëâ If you're using **Raspberry Pi** - you need to use the `:arm` tag for the image (depends on your CPU arch tho)

Go to
[**Docker Image Configurator**](https://portal.devlike.pro/docker-image)
to generate the command with the right image.
{{< /details >}}


### Pre-requisites
Before proceeding, make sure you have the latest version of `docker` and `docker compose` installed.

As of now *at the time of writing this doc*, we recommend a version equal to or higher than the following.

```bash
$ docker --version
Docker version 26.1.3, build b72abbb
$ docker compose version
Docker Compose version v2.27.0
```

{{< details "Why Docker?" >}}
**Docker** makes it easy to ship **all-in-one solution** with the runtime and dependencies.
You don't have to worry about language-specific libraries or chrome installation.

Also, Docker makes installation and update processes so simple, just one command!
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "Why Docker Compose?" >}}
**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running Docker applications.
With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services.
Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
{{< /details >}}

### Get docker image
We'll use
[**‚ûï WAHA Plus**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/plus-version" >}}) docker image in the guide:

```bash
docker login -u devlikeapro -p {KEY}
docker pull devlikeapro/waha-plus
docker logout
```

üëâ Go to
[**Docker Image Configurator**](https://portal.devlike.pro/docker-image)
to generate the command with the latest version and your key!


Alternatively, you can use the **WAHA Core** image:

```bash
docker pull devlikeapro/waha
```
{{< details "I got <i>docker: no matching manifest for linux/arm64/v8 in the manifest list entries</i> error">}}
Looks like you're using **ARM** architecture, you need to use the `:arm` tag for the image.

üëâ Go to
[**Docker Image Configurator**](https://portal.devlike.pro/docker-image)
to generate the command with the latest version and your key!

```bash
docker login -u devlikeapro -p {KEY}
docker pull devlikeapro/waha-plus:arm
docker logout

# Rename it, so you can use devlikeapro/waha image in other place
docker tag devlikeapro/waha-plus:arm devlikeapro/waha-plus
```

Go to
[**Docker Image Configurator**](https://portal.devlike.pro/docker-image)
to generate the command with the right image.

## Install

1. Install Docker on your VM
```bash
# example in ubuntu
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
apt install docker-compose-plugin
```

2. Download the required files
```bash
# Download the env file template
wget -O .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devlikeapro/waha/refs/heads/core/.env
# Download the Docker compose template
wget -O docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devlikeapro/waha/refs/heads/core/docker-compose.yaml
```

3. Tweak the `.env` and `docker-compose.yaml` according to your preferences. 
Refer to the available environment variables in [**‚öôÔ∏è Configuration**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/config" >}}).

Some important values you **MUST** change before running it:

- API Key for secure API access. Read more [**üîí Security**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/security" >}})
   - `WHATSAPP_API_KEY=123`
- Username, password for [**üìä Dashboard**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/waha-dashboard" >}}):
   - `WAHA_DASHBOARD_USERNAME=waha`
   - `WAHA_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=waha`
- Username, password for [**üìö Swagger**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/swagger" >}}):
   - `WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_USERNAME=admin`
   - `WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_PASSWORD=admin`

```bash
# update .env file with your values
nano .env
# update docker-compose.yaml - like image
# Remove "mongodb" and "minio" services if you don't need them
# Leave "waha" service as it is
nano docker-compose.yaml
```

4. Get the service up and running.
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5. Your WAHA installation is complete. 
Please note that the **containers are not exposed to the internet**, and they only bind to the localhost. 
Setup something like Nginx or any other proxy server to proxy the requests to the container.

6. Now, open [http://localhost:3000/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard) and login with the credentials you've set
   (`waha/waha` by default).

Also, you could temporarily drop the `127.0.0.1:3000:3000` for **waha** to `3000:3000` in the compose file to access your instance at `http://<your-external-ip>:3000`. 
It's recommended to revert this change back and use Nginx or some proxy server in the front.

### Additional Steps
#### Configure Nginx and Let's Encrypt 
üëâ Replace **yourdomain.com** with your domain name in the following steps.

1. Configure Nginx to serve as a frontend proxy.
```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
nano yourdomain.com.conf
```

2. Use the following Nginx config after replacing the `yourdomain.com` in `server_name`.
```
server {
  server_name <yourdomain.com>;

  # Point upstream to WAHA Server
  set $upstream 127.0.0.1:3000;

  location /.well-known {
    alias /var/www/ssl-proof/waha/.well-known;
  }

  location / {
    proxy_pass_header Authorization;
    proxy_pass http://$upstream;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Ssl on; # Optional

    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Connection ‚Äú‚Äù;
    proxy_buffering off;

    client_max_body_size 0;
    proxy_read_timeout 36000s;
    proxy_redirect off;
  }
  listen 80;
}
```

3. Verify and reload your Nginx config by running the following command.
```bash
nginx -t
systemctl reload nginx
```

4. Run Let's Encrypt to configure SSL certificate.
```bash
apt  install certbot
apt-get install python3-certbot-nginx
mkdir -p /var/www/ssl-proof/waha/.well-known
certbot --webroot -w /var/www/ssl-proof/waha/ -d yourdomain.com -i nginx
```

5. Your WAHA installation should be accessible from the https://yourdomain.com now.

## Update
üëâ If you specified exact version in `docker-compose.yml`, like
```yaml
image: devlikeapro/waha-plus:latest-2024.7.8
```
remember to change it to `latest-{YEAR}.{MONTH}.{BUILD}` to get the latest version.

When there's a new version of WAHA, you can update it with a single commands:

[**‚ûï WAHA Plus**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/plus-version" >}}) image:
```bash
# Login if you're using WAHA Plus
docker login -u devlikeapro -p {KEY}
docker compose pull
docker logout

docker compose up -d
```

**WAHA Core** image:
```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## Get logs, restart, stop
```bash
# Stop all containers
docker compose down
# Start all containers
docker compose up -d
# Restart all containers
docker compose restart
# Show logs in real time
docker compose logs -f
# Show logs - since interval
docker compose logs --since 1h  
```
